# CIM Template
The CIM template serves as a launching point for creating your Composable Information Machine (CIM), a system designed to manage and process your information with semantic precision. Imagine harnessing the vast capabilities of the internet as if it were a single, cohesive machine—this is the vision behind CIM.

Our journey begins with a foundational platform, which we'll customize to meet your specific information management needs, ensuring a reliable and scalable approach to handling distributed information.

Instead of overwhelming you with information from the start, which could take days or weeks to master, we adopt a learn-as-you-go approach. With just 30 minutes of initial setup, you'll be on your way to developing and shaping your domain. We leverage immediately AI Agents for conversational tools to further refine your domain's creation.

The customization of your CIM is crucial because no two domains are identical. Even with similar components, the unique application of resources — guided by specific requirements and industry standards — ensures your system remains distinctly yours.

Change is inevitable, whether it's adopting new technologies or preparing for unforeseen disasters. Our goal is to equip you to swiftly adapt as needed.

The first step is cloning this repository and establishing an environment. We'll introduce neo4j early on to facilitate visualizing your domain as it evolves. At this stage, concerns about event handling, commands, queries, or storage can be set aside; everything is neatly encapsulated within this new git repository.

Let's dive into a `flake.nix` based configuration to gain a clear understanding of its role and functionalities. This initial setup is crucial for ensuring a solid grasp of how your CIM operates.
